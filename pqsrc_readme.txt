ProQuake is a modification of WinQuake, not QuakeWorld.  To keep things
simple, I just zipped up the entire WinQuake source directory, including
the MSVC++ 6.0 files.

*All* changes to the source are labelled by comments starting with // JPG

Wow, this is the shortest readme.txt I've ever made.

=================
License Agreement
=================

Please read gnu.txt.  The follwoing is from the quake source readme.txt:

"The code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license).  
You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do 
anything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch 
is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the 
entire source code available for free to everyone."
